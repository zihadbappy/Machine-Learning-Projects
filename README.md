# Machine-Learning-Projects
These are some models I have developed as I learned Machine Learning with Python.

**Libraries Used:**

 *pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, cufflinks, nltk,  nltk.corpus, sklearn*


NB: Github sometimes can't render Jupyter Notebook(.ipynb) files. Please, copy the project url and paste it here to see the full model. https://nbviewer.org/
